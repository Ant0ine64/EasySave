Thank you for downloading EasySave. In this manual, you will find an overview of the most used features, and a guide on how to use them properly. 
EasySave is an offline backup application. It can be used to backup a project folder, an important folder, a folder with any files or anything else, to a backup directory that must be specified. EasySafe is then able to update the backup if the file content changes, by making a full backup, i.e. overwriting the previous backup, or by making a differential backup, i.e. backing up only what has been changed or added in the folder.
